==Testing Prerequisites==

In order to run a complete testsuite there are necessary two distinct persistence units. One will be used to persist test data and the other to persist audit data. 

Both persistence units are configured in the main `pom.xml`.

==Release Process==

1. Run a full testsuite and record the results in the "Test Situation" section

2. Make sure all JIRA issues for the release are resolved. Shift to the next release anything that is still open.

3. Synchronize work area with the SVN repository.

4. Tag:
{{{
    svn copy https://hibernate-audit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://hibernate-audit.googlecode.com/svn/tags/HBA_1_0_0_Alpha5 -m "releasing ..."
}}}

5. Build the binary jar and the source jar for export to various repositories.

6. Increment the version in the main pom.xml and com/googlecode/hibernate/audit/pom.xml

7. Release in JIRA
