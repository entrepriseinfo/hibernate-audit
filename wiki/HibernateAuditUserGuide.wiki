=Implementation Details=

Collection directionality information is not maintained in the original model, so that's why we introduced the AUDIT_EVENT_PAIR_COLLECTION table. 

If a collection item is removed from a collection, there are at least two ways to express this change:

1. UPDATE and the delta is the remaining collection content 

2. REMOVE and the delta is the removed member. This is a lot better in expressing the semantic of the change, and also in terms of space used.
