=Implementation Details=

Collection directionality information is not maintained in the original model, so that's why we introduced the AUDIT_EVENT_PAIR_COLLECTION table. 

If a collection item is removed from a collection, there are at least two ways to express this change:

1. UPDATE and the delta is the remaining collection content. It's easier to implement, because this is the information Hibernate pushes to its listener. HBA uses this method.

2. REMOVE and the delta is the removed member. This is a lot better in expressing the semantic of the change, and also in terms of space used, but it's difficult to figure out the delta, unless going even deeper within hibernate.
